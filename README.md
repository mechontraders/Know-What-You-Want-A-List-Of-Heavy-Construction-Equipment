# Know-What-You-Want-A-List-Of-Heavy-Construction-Equipment
The equipment for used Construction is generally very complex and heavy. Each kind of heavy construction equipment is designed to make construction works easier. 
These construction equipment are used for work involving excavation, dozing, earth work operations and much more complex duties. Construction equipment should be carefully selected after studying the construction project. It is important to know the different kinds of heavy construction equipment so as to make the right choice for the execution of construction duties.

The selection of the right construction or mining equipment enhances the safety, work speed and productivity. Let us take a look at a list of heavy equipment used for construction. The heavy construction equipment is mainly divided into four categories—

●	Earth Moving Heavy Equipment
●	Construction Vehicles
●	Material Handling Heavy Equipment
●	Other Heavy Construction Equipment


Earth Moving Heavy Equipment

This category includes the following heavy equipment used in the field of construction such as Bulldozers, Loaders, Excavators, Crawler Loaders, Motor Graders, Motor Scrapers, Trencers.

-	Bulldozers

It’s a very large tractor used in the field of construction in order to push down a building, soil and rubble.
 
-	Loaders

A loader is a construction equipment that is used in the site of a project to move around loads of materials brought into the site. The loader speed up the work, time and energy of humans. It also helps with demolition like bulldozers.

-	Excavators

It is one of the most commonly used heavy construction equipment. This earth moving heavy machinery vehicle has a rotating bucket and an arm. Excavators are widely used as they take care of the works of bulldozers and loaders at once.

Construction Vehicles

-	Trailers

Trailer is a group of unpowered vehicle being pulled by a powered vehicle and moving together like a trail. It is mostly used for transporting goods.

-	Dumper

As the name suggests, it’s a heavy vehicle that helps on the site to carry bulk material. It is an open vehicle with the load in front of the dump truck driver.

Material Handling Equipment

-	Cranes

Cranes are usually used to pick heavy things, transport them horizontally and place the load wherever required. It is a type of heavy equipment with wires, ropes and chains.
 
-	Forklift

A forklift is heavy machinery with two fork divisions. That of a fork is the machinery used to move bulky things in the construction site. Forklift is to move around heavy things around short distances.

-	Conveyor

Unlike the other heavy equipment vehicles this is very compact to move around the load around the places of construction sites or from the marketplace to the construction site.


Other Construction Equipment

-	Concrete Mixers

Concrete mixers mostly known as cement mixers are heavy machinery that combines cement and other ingredients. It is an efficient heavy equipment that is made from the site and the machine takes care to avoid hardening of the cement and giving ample amount of work.

-	Road Rollers

It is a heavy engineering equipment vehicle that is used to compactly press the road to the soil. Road rollers are also known as steamrollers due to the amount of steam produced but it.

-	Hot Mix Plants

It is widely known as asphalt plants which are used for mixing different things to aid the construction with the required temperature. With the help of hot mix plants we are able to keep construction materials at their required temperature.
 
There are more and other heavy equipment at different construction sites such as Road Making Machines, Stone Crushers, Boom lift, Scissor lift, Tunneling equipment and much more. Likewise the huge choices and an important determination of the right heavy equipment for construction sites, there are many brands as who provide you with the heavy equipment spare parts. It is equally important to choose the right kind of machinery from the best brands like CAT, Perkins, Donaldson, Cummins, WIX filters, Volvo penta and TATA.

The determination of the right choice of equipment is an important one as construction sites are also constantly varied. We should understand that it’s important to do our homework to study about the best suited machineries and best brands to make a purchase. This will help you to be closer to the best decision which will internally give you good socio and economic benefits with machinery. So make the best choice for an everlasting experience of your purchase.
